    Nearest Neighbor heuristic for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

    Uses a precomputed distance matrix where distances[i, j] is the shortest-path

    unvisited stop at each step.

    Feasible for graphs with a couple of thousands nodes.

    :param node_to_index: Dictionary of nodes and its corresponding index.

    :param return_to_start: If True, closes the tour by returning to `start`.
